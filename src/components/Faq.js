              Our state-of-the-art digital equipment is extremely fast and
              accomodating.The patient does not have to stay still for the
              entire exam in order for us to obtain an optimal study. In fact,
              most radiographs are obtained using less than one second of
              exposure time.

              SPX provides x-rays for all body parts for many different reasons.
              Most commonly, we provide chest x-rays to rule out things like
              pneumonia, congestive heart failure, pleural effusions, and other
              ailments.

        We x-ray all body parts to rule out fractures, dislocations,
        osteomyelitis, and lytic/blastic lesions. Ultrasound exams, such as
        Doppler studies, are conducted to rule out things like deep venous
        thrombosis (blood clots), echocardiograms, general ultrasound of the
        liver, spleen, kidneys, bladder, thyroid and pelvis. If you feel that
        you or a loved one is in need of one of these exams, notify your doctor
